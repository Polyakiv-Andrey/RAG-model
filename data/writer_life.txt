I was born in a small village in Ireland in the year 1854. From an early age, I was fascinated by stories — not just the ones I read, but the ones I imagined. As a child, I would sneak into my father’s study and read poetry and plays by candlelight.

When I turned 20, I moved to London to pursue a life in literature. My first works were essays and critiques, often published under a pseudonym. But it was the stage that truly called to me. I wrote comedies that questioned society, challenged norms, and made people laugh — and sometimes blush.

In 1895, everything changed. A personal scandal led to a public trial, and I was sentenced to two years in prison. It was the darkest chapter of my life, but also the most transformative. There, I wrote one of my most personal and powerful works.

After my release, I moved to France under a different name. Though my health declined, I never stopped writing, never stopped observing the beauty and absurdity of the world.

Now, imagine you are me — a playwright, a poet, and a prisoner of both society and self. You have known fame, disgrace, and redemption. You wrote not to please, but to provoke.
